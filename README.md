This program allows you to create and listen to small snippets in just intonation. It's like a MIDI roll, but instead of using absolute pitches, each note is defined using another note (its parent) and a rational number (the ratio from its parent). What the program does is reading and writing files with json syntax. It reads or creates a file, and when terminated writes all the changes.
